# trackretrack

Track points through video, and then re-track to minimize drift.

## Install
Install the following dependencies:
- SciPy
- OpenCV

Then run `python3 setup.py install` as usual.
Apart from the Python library `trackretrack`, this also installs a script with the same name that can be run from the command line.
